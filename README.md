### Fork the repo first then clone your fork to your local repo

When working on the project:

1.  Always update your local repo first (sync your fork to the original repo via GitHub)
2.  Create a branch first and name it with what you're working with (ex. example-branch)
    `git branch example-branch`
3.  Checkout the branch
    `git checkout example-branch`
4.  Edit your code
5.  Add then commit your code
    `git add .`
    `git commit -m "example commit"`
6.  Push your code to your fork
    `git push origin example-branch`
7.  Create a pull request via GitHub
